        	<h5>Ted Morency</h5>
            <h6>Fundraising</h6>
	        <p>As a child born and partially raised in Haiti, I learned the importance of education from an early age. This journey started when I left Port-Au-Prince at the age of five to go to the suburbs of Ewing, New Jersey, where my family and I originally stayed with my uncle. I then gained a scholarship to go the Ross School of East Hampton, New York from eighth to twelfth grade. This is where I was able to luckily meet Arthur and Jonathan and begin working as a fundraiser for Wings Over Haiti. I now attend Cornell University and am planning to major in Linguistics with a minor in either Russian or French.</p>
