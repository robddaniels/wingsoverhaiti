                <cite>We learned</cite> the meaning of a Hatian saying: <strong>"Little by little, a bird builds its nest."</strong> We know that in order to create a thriving school, with dedicated personel and community involvement, you do it slowly and carefully. So, we do everything we can to insure the infrastructure is every bit as strong as the physical structures.

                <cite>We learned</cite> we need ownership of the land so we can't be pushed around. <strong>So</strong>, we bought the land for our first school and we own the 7 acres we're building on now.

        		<cite>We learned</cite> children have to be fed before they can learn. Unfortunately, we lost one of our students to malnutrition and that will never happen again. <strong>So</strong>, we feed the kids 2 meals a day and we supply medical attention.
